It was somewhere between year 2008 and 2009 when an acquaintance of mine asked for help with PalmIIIxe. The *issue* with device was that it had German user interface and my task was to find out if it would be possible to change UI to English. Considering the fact that I had never heard of such device before, this task seemed quite daunting. Eventually I learned technical details of this handheld from resources on internet still available at that time, but I failed with language change since I found it impossible or at least I thought so. Eventually I was approached with help request by same person, software coding related issue where I could help. I was promised that if I succeed, I could have the Palm device as a reward, I had no problem with giving some hand without getting anything in return, but device was so tempting that I agreed anyways. In the very beginning there wasn’t such interest in these handhelds as it is now, most of the knowledge about them I have learned during last two years. I don’t consider myself as an expert, I did not use PDAs when they rose in popularity or its peak - I was a kid at that time and barely knew that cell phone existed, ha ha. I have always liked world history subject and find IT history interesting as well, where Palm PDAs and similar devices are an integral part. Since that time I have become avid with handhelds. So the rest is history now…
