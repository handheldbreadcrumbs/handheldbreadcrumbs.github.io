I have always liked world history subject and find IT history interesting as well, where Palm PDAs and similar devices are an integral part.
I don't consider myself an expert, did not use PDAs when they were popular, when they rose in popularity or its peak - I was a kid at that time and barely knew that cell phone existed, ha ha. Got my first Palm device about 7 years ago and since then I am avid fan and enthusiastic about history of handhelds in general. I do understand that Palm devices are niche or even obscure for some people and in some way they are obsolete too, but there is a lot where of people could benefit from the ideas it carries. This blog is used to document my findings related to Palm devices and handhelds as well.
