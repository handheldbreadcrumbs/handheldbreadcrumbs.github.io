For some time I have an interest in [Palm PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)){:target="_blank"} devices, since I really enjoy finding information about different kinds of computing devices in general, mostly microcomputers from 1970s, 1980s I find personal digital assistants very interesting too. I am not quite sure whether Palm devices can be called retro computers yet, but it is my sort of version of [retrocomputing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrocomputing){:target="_blank"}. As with other computing devices an integral part of Palm PDA is its software. Normally software will be running on real hardware, but there are other cases when software can be running in emulated environment for example writing, testing, and debugging software. In this post I am going to document steps I did to build software emulator - Palm OS Emulator from source code available from [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pose/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pose/){:target="_blank"} in GNU/Linux environment i.e. Debian operating system.
