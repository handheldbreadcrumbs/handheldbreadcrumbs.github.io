Today together with [Andrew's Pilot Page](http://web.archive.org/web/19981206010148/http://www.iosphere.net/~howlett/pilot/){:target="_blank"} I added many links to pages with great source of information related not only to programming, but Palm OS internals as well. Need to find out how to automate process of link addition to make this process more convenient.
