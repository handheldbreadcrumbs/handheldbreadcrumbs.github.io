This morning I noticed interesting lot on ebay, at first it seemed to be a common Palm Pilot Professional by 3COM in original box with manuals, software CDs and also with a modem included. Although *modem* had same type of housing as Palm Modem, it had different markings on it e.g. "Palm Navigator", "Precision Navigation, Inc". So I became eager to find out more information what it is all about. It was not a modem after all, but a sensor module, basically what it turns your palm into electronic compass. This device has been reviewed<sup>[[1]](http://the-gadgeteer.com/1998/05/03/palm_navigator_review/){:target="_blank"}</sup> in the past and it has received good feedback<sup>[[2]](http://www.verycomputer.com/21_5d90b8c63ca38561_1.htm){:target="_blank"}</sup>.
I am wondering if software for this device is still available, since it is possible to check it in demo mode even without having the compass itself.
