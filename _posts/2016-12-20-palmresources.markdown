From time to time I checkout posts from [Palmorama](http://www.palmorama.net/){:target="_blank"}, blog focused on handheld computing related topics. [PalmPilot Stuff](http://web.archive.org/web/20161220091747/http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/rees/pilot/){:target="_blank"} is an interesting find [here](http://www.palmorama.net/2016/12/yeah-theres-still-some-pretty.html){:target="_blank"} for sure and it was not even in my own cache of links, I wonder how many functioning Palm related sites still are there. I have added it to 'Palm related resources' page.
