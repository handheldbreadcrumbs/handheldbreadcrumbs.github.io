I have added one more link - [SiEd - Text Editing for Palms](https://web.archive.org/web/20070323092635/http://benroe.com/sied/index.php){:target="_blank"} to Software section of resources page. I have never used this application and found out about it by accident while looking information about AlphaSmart Dana SDK. There is specific Dana version of SiEd written and source code can be viewed on this github repository - [SiEd-Dana - A Text Editor Optimized for the AlphaSmart Dana](https://github.com/rtiangha/SiEd){:target="_blank"}, it appears to be a fork of original SiEd Palm OS text editor project, optimized for the AlphaSmart Dana's widescreen display.
