TinyELF is interesting piece of software that's for sure. TinyELF emulates the ELF computer described in Joseph Weisbecker's 1976 Popular Electronics article as well as the 1861 Pixie graphics added later. For those who prefer hex keypads to toggle switches, TinyELF also emulates the layout of the Netronics ELF II. So far I see that it should be supported by PalmIIIc.
